The “FullStack Army” a learning platform of programming under the monitoring of the best promising programmer in BD Mr. H M Nayem. As a student we were selected for building an E-commerce web application. We chose our product as a “book” and named it as “BOOKMARK”.
This application is fully made of modern technology in running trends of the IT industry.
Bookmark is a modern looking e-commerce application where buyers and visitors have a lot more interaction. We tried to make the project with a lot of features and ongoing events unlike a traditional e-commerce has. We tried to explore every portion of technology regarding requirement issues and emphasized each detail like a professional approach.

## Planning part:

First we planned how an e-commerce web application was structured and its merits of events and interaction to justify the user experience.
For that we explore some real world e-commerce like ROKOMARI and other applications and see the interaction of users then try to list the sections that need to be scrutinized.
After selecting an application site we mixed our thoughts to build the site as modern trendy. We listed the UI and layout of the project regarding our requirements. We also took a styled framework Material UI so that it could look glossy.

## Making of UI

- Component tree:

  First we drew the component tree of the web site. According to the planning part it will make a perfect way to find out the UI level so that it will show the overall outlooking and the components how interrelated. Finding the reusable components and important components our planned made easy to express the data in our site.
- Wireframe:

  We use the wireframe to design our interface how it looks, with some pages and components. From the component tree our design made easy deciding the features of our product.
